Data Analysis and visualization on Parafield, SA  temperature dataset

1. Compute the normalized histogram of Tmin and Tmax for the above data. Compute and plot cumulative distribution function (cdf) from the histograms.
2. Calculate Pearson correlation coefficient (r) between Tmax and Tmin .
3. Interpret the r2 value you got.
4. Plot the scatter plot from of Tmax â†’ Tmin.
5. Now plot the smoothed scatter plot without sorting and observe the plot.
6. Plot smoothed scatter plot with sorting and observe the difference with the plot of above. State how smoothed scatter plot is in some ways better than usual scatter plot.
